The [micro:bit](https://microbit.org/) Educational Foundation is an awesome initiative that was created by a [UK-based not for profit organization](https://microbit.org/about/) with the goal of getting everyone to learn to code. micro:bits are small pieces of hardware that you can program and it's a lot of fun.

Most people I know are at home with their children due to COVID-19 at the moment, so I thought this would be a fun activity that your child or your child and you can do. Even as an adult, it's quite a lot of fun. üòÉ

Microsoft has a project associated with micro:bit called [MakeCode](https://makecode.microbit.org/#editor) that is an online editor that also includes a micro:bit emulator. If you don't own the hardware yet, the emulator is a great tool to start with.

I created my kid's first assignment tomorrow and thought it would be fun to post it here.

## The Assignment

Make a tiny game called the Random Dot Game.

## Starting the Game

When the game starts, show the word ‚ÄúHi‚Äù

## Pressing the A Button

If you press the A button, show one LED light on the grid if the X position (horizontal position) is not equal to four. However, if the X position of the LED is equal to four, show a heart icon. Feel free to use a different number. I just happened to pick four.

Note: The grid positions go from 0-4 for the X and Y positions.

## Pressing the B Button

If you press the B button, it ends the game and shows the words ‚ÄúGAME OVER‚Äù and then shows the word ‚ÄúHi‚Äù so the game can start over.

## micro:bit Blocks Required for this Project

Below are all the micro:bit blocks required to build the game. If you are not sure what a Microbit-block does, check out their help, https://makecode.microbit.org/reference

## Demo and Solution

Here is the [demo](https://makecode.microbit.org/_9zKDVEg1cCP3). It includes the answer so make sure that you've clicked on the Simulator tab so that your child does not see the answer.

Have fun! Until the next assignment. üëãüèª
